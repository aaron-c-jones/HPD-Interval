# Highest-Posterior-Density-Interval---Python-R
Codes in Python and R that computes the Highest Posterior Density interval (Bayesian statistics) for posterior distributions that are invertible.

Python: In the code, the distribution I am testing on is the standard normal distribution. Of course, you wouldn't need the code to figure out this interval. However, in terms of testing, it is easy to confirm the quality of the code using this distribution.

R: In this code, I am computing the HPD interval for the Beta distribution. I have defined specific posterior parameters in the first chunk of code. I have also included code for a plot of the interval overlayed on the density curve using ggplot2.
