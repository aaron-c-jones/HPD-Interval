# HPD-Interval
Coded in Python and R.

Two code files that compute the Highest Posterior Density interval (Bayesian) for invertible posterior distributions. File one (R) computes and plots the HPD Interval for the given beta distribution. File two (Python) computes the HPD Interval for the standard normal distribution. The HPD Interval for the standard normal distribution would never actually need to be coded in this way (because of symmetry) except for demonstration purposes as is the case here.
